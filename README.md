# 🚀 $CHODE Tapper: Girth to Earn 🚀

## The Degen Ascension Plan Has Begun!

Welcome, fellow accumulators of digital density, to the official repository for **$CHODE Tapper: Girth to Earn**! This isn't just a game; it's a cyber-meme tapper where the sacred act of slapping the **Big Chode** generates that most valuable of resources: **$GIRTH**. Unlock insane degen-boosts, ascend your very member, and eventually connect your wallet to immortalize your legendary Girth on-chain. The more you tap, the harder the gains. The loop is simple, the reward: eternal Chode fame among the degen elite.

## 🎮 Game Mechanics (Phase 0 - MVP Scope)

Prepare your clicking finger. The grind is real, and it is _girthy_.

### 1. Tapping Core: The Sacred Slap

The heart of the game. Your primary interaction is with the **Central $CHODE Icon** – not merely a button, but the very Altar of Girth.

* **Primary Interaction:** Tap the Central $CHODE.
* **$GIRTH Generation:** Each tap generates 1 base $GIRTH.
* **Onscreen Juiciness (The "Chode Feedback Loop"):**
    * **Squash & Stretch:** The $CHODE visibly reacts to each tap with satisfying compression and subtle overextension.
    * **Screen Shake:** Subtle shakes on normal taps, escalating for critical hits and boost activations.
    * **Synthy Click SFX:** A variety of satisfying synth bloops, with a rare, coveted "squish" for critical taps.
    * **Particle Bursts:** Glowing, slightly jiggly "Girth Particles" explode from the point of impact.
    * **Damage Numbers Afloat:** Watch your $GIRTH accumulate with arcade-style floating numbers ($+1 GIRTH!, +5 GIRTH (CRITICAL SLAP!)).
* **Tap Formula:** $GIRTH = base × multiplier × boost modifiers.

### 2. Multiplier & Boost System: The Degen Power-Ups

Unlock temporary (or permanently upgraded via the Shop) boosts to maximize your Girth generation. Each activation comes with an **OVER-THE-TOP** visual and audio cue.

* **ChodeBot (Autotapper):**
    * **Effect:** +1 tap/sec automatically.
    * **Cost:** 100 $GIRTH (Phase 0).
    * **Aesthetic:** A small, hovering robotic chode appears, dutifully 'tapping' with lasers or pistons. Accompanied by gentle "pew-pew" or "clink-clink" sounds.
    * **Upgrades:** Increase taps/sec, spawn multiple ChodeBots.
* **Girthquake (Power Tap):**
    * **Effect:** 5x $GIRTH multiplier for 10 seconds.
    * **Cost:** 500 $GIRTH (Phase 0).
    * **Aesthetic:** The main $CHODE swells and thumps down. Screen cracks appear, intense screen shake, background flashes red. Sound: Deep bass drop, "THWOOMP," echoing quake sounds.
    * **Upgrades:** Increase multiplier, increase duration.
* **OozeDrip (Passive Girth):**
    * **Effect:** +0.1 $GIRTH/sec passively.
    * **Cost:** 1,000 $GIRTH (Phase 0).
    * **Aesthetic:** The $CHODE emits a gentle, glowing "ooze" dripping into the $GIRTH counter. Sound: Subtle, satisfying "gloop...gloop..." or a gentle synth pad.
    * **Upgrades:** Increase $GIRTH/sec.
* **Foresight Chain (Combo Streak - The Skill Stick):**
    * **Effect:** +1% $GIRTH per tap for every 10 rapid taps (within 0.5s). Bonus applies to the next tap.
    * **Aesthetic:** A counter shows your rapid tap chain. Glowing rings or energy crackles appear around the $CHODE with each successful link.
    * **COMBO RUSH:** After 20 rapid taps (chain count hits 2), screen pulses dramatically (maybe color invert), "COMBO RUSH!" text explodes. For 5 seconds, all $GIRTH gains are multiplied by an additional 2x (stacks with Girthquake!). Sound: **MANDATORY orgasmic 80s guitar solo burst!**
    * **Cost:** N/A (Skill-based).
* **Boost Cooldowns:** Clearly visible timers on boost buttons. They pulse/glow when ready.

### 3. Upgrades Shop: The Path to Maximum Girth

Access the **SHOP** (shaped like a "members only" club entrance) to spend your hard-earned $GIRTH and enhance your capabilities.

* **The $CHODE Itself - "Ascend Your Member":**
    * Unlock visually distinct tiers of the Central $CHODE (Basic, Veiny, Cracked Open, Radiant, Cosmic).
    * Each tier grants a small permanent boost to base $GIRTH or reduces upgrade costs.
* **Tapper Enhancements - "Finger Workouts":**
    * Upgrade your manual tap strength, ChodeBot army effectiveness, Girthquake potency, OozeDrip rate, and Combo Rush mastery.
* **Cosmetic Themes - "Chode Couture":**
    * Apply insane visual themes (Cyberpink Slime, VoidGreen Matrix, SynthGold Pimp, OG Degen) that change UI, background, $CHODE skin, and particle effects.
* **Rare Skins (NFTs later) - "Exotic Specimens":** Unique and outlandish $CHODE appearances with special effects and sounds (Diamond, Nyan, Glitch, Banana).
* **Shop UI:** Clear costs, impactful "BUY" buttons with satisfying "cha-ching" or synth confirmation sounds.

### 4. Wallet Connection & On-Chain Integration: Flex Your Girth Globally

Prepare for ultimate degen flex by connecting your wallet and immortalizing your Girthy achievements.

* **Connect Wallet to Ascend Button:** Prominently displayed and glowing with divine light.
* **Wallet Providers (MVP):** MetaMask (EVM compatible) will be supported initially.
* **On-Chain Data Strategy:**
    * Total $GIRTH stored off-chain initially (via a trusted backend) to avoid gas fees.
    * Significant achievements are snapshotted for on-chain representation.
* **"On-Chain Chode Badge" NFT Mint:**
    * **Trigger:** First wallet connection AND reaching a respectable $GIRTH milestone (e.g., 1,000,000 $GIRTH or unlocking the 3rd $CHODE tier). This is an earned achievement.
    * **Standard:** ERC-721 or ERC-1155 on a suitable EVM L2 (Polygon, Arbitrum, Base).
    * **Metadata:** Includes badge name, image of a glorious chode-themed medal, date of ascension, peak $GIRTH at mint.
    * **Utility (MVP):** Pure, unadulterated bragging rights. Displayed in-game if wallet connected.
* **Weekly $CHODE Leaderboard Prizes:** Compete for the top spot (leaderboard off-chain, fed by backend). Prizes could include small amounts of meme coin, unique cosmetic NFTs, or "Eternal GigaChode Respect."

## 🔊 Aesthetic & Vibe: Maximum Degen Overdrive

Prepare for a sensory assault of **Cyberpunk Dumpster Fire Chic**.

* **Art Style:** A glorious fusion of sleek cyberpunk neon and unhinged, low-brow meme imagery. Think TRON's cool older brother who lives in a landfill and trades JPEGs.
* **Visual Effects:** Glitch FX, datamoshing, scanlines, and chromatic aberration on boost activations and high combos. Vaporwave HUD elements with gritty, pixelated text.
* **Evolving Cityscape Background:** Starts as a grimy back alley with flickering neon, evolves through skyscrapers and holographic meme ads, culminating in "Girthopolis" – a futuristic city dominated by colossal, glowing $CHODE statues and a swirling $GIRTH energy vortex sky.
* **Sound Design:** A symphony of slappage! Varied synth bloops, the rare "squish," LOUD and obnoxious signature boost sounds (DEEP bass for Girthquake, cute robot noises for ChodeBot), and the legendary 80s guitar solo for COMBO RUSH. Background tracks are "degen lo-fi hip hop / synthwave to accumulate $GIRTH to."
* **Meme SFX:** Sparingly used iconic, short meme sounds for extreme achievements or rare events (use with caution!).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This glorious monument to Girth is being constructed with the following sacred tools:

*   **Game Engine:** Godot Engine (Targeting version 4.x for modern features, maximum Girth, and GDScript 2.0).
*   **Scripting Language:** GDScript – The native tongue of Godot, chosen for its elegance and tight integration.
*   **Version Control:** Git – To meticulously track every Girthful addition and sacred change.
*   **Backend (Future):** While Phase 0 focuses on local saves, future on-chain integration and leaderboards will necessitate a backend solution (specifics TBD, but likely a lean, scalable option).
*   **Art & Audio Tools:** A glorious amalgam of tools as befits "Cyberpunk Dumpster Fire Chic" (e.g., Aseprite for pixel art, Krita/GIMP for digital painting, Audacity/DAWs for sound).

## 🏗️ Godot Architecture (Targeting 4.x for modern features)

A solid foundation for maximum Girth.

* **Scene Structure:**
    * `Main.tscn`: Root node, manages overall state, instantiates other scenes.
    * `TapperArea.tscn`: Handles input detection and the Central $CHODE's visual/audio feedback. Contains Area2D/TextureButton, AnimatedSprite2D, Particles2D, AudioStreamPlayer2D.
    * `HUD.tscn` (CanvasLayer): Displays $GIRTH count, boost buttons (with cooldowns), Combo Streak/Rush text.
    * `Shop.tscn` (PopupPanel/CanvasLayer): The interface for purchasing upgrades and cosmetics. Contains ScrollContainer and custom `UpgradeItem.tscn` instances.
    * `WalletPopup.tscn`: Handles wallet connection UI.
* **Global.gd (Autoload Singleton):** Manages core game state (current $GIRTH, upgrade levels, active boosts, cooldowns), handles $GIRTH logic, purchases, boost activations, and save/load functionality. Emits signals for UI updates (`girth_updated`, `combo_rush_started`, `new_chode_tier_unlocked`, etc.).
* **Saving State:** Local persistence via Godot's File access (saving to `user://` as JSON). Periodic syncing with a backend for logged-in users/wallet connection.
* **Wallet Integration:** Utilizing `JavaScriptBridge.eval()` for web builds to interact with browser wallet SDKs (like MetaMask).

## 💡 GigaChode's Pro-Degen Tactical Expansions (Phase 0 Blueprint & Beyond)

This is just the beginning. The path to true Girth is paved with ridiculous achievements and future possibilities. Phase 0 focuses on the core loop and essential boosts/upgrades. Future Girthspansions include:

* **Achievements with Outrageous Names:** Track milestones with titles like "First Spurt," "Premature Girthification," "Blue Chode Special," "Unsolicited Chode Pic," and "The Chode Less Traveled."
* **Prestige System - "Rebirth the Chode":** Reset your progress upon reaching a massive $GIRTH cap to earn "Chode Souls" (premium currency) for permanent global multipliers and exclusive visual flair/NFTs ("Prestige Badges").
* **Flavor Text Overload:** Every element of the UI will be saturated with evolving, ridiculous Chode-themed flavor text.
* **Daily Login Bonus - "Morning Wood-en Nickel":** Rewarding consistent players with daily and weekly $GIRTH injections.
* **Evolving Cityscape Visuals:** The background dynamically changes based on total $GIRTH accumulated or $CHODE tier.
* **More Boosts & Fusions:** Introduce even more unhinged Degen Power-Ups and discoverable Fusion Boosts.
* **Advanced Wallet Features:** Deeper on-chain interactions, NFT-gated content, leaderboards reflecting on-chain data.

## Next Steps (Let's Build!)

Based on the Blueprint, our immediate focus is:

1.  **Lock in Art Style & Placeholder Assets:** Sketch out the $CHODE tiers, basic boost icons, and a UI wireframe. Embrace the glorious cyberpunk trash aesthetic using placeholder assets that scream "DEGEN."
2.  **Build Wireframe Mockup:** Create a visual layout of the game screen (digital or even MS Paint) to map out the placement of the $CHODE, $GIRTH counter, boost buttons, and cityscape background.
3.  **Start Godot Boilerplate:**
    * Set up the `Global.gd` autoload singleton.
    * Create `Main.tscn` and `TapperArea.tscn` with basic input detection (printing to console for now).
    * Implement the basic $GIRTH counter and connect it to the tapping action via a signal from `TapperArea` to `Global.gd`, updating the counter in the `HUD.tscn`.
4.  **Define Initial Data Structures:** Outline the JSON structure for local saves (`player_save.json`) including `girth`, `upgrade_levels` (e.g., `{chode_level: 1, chodebot_level: 0}`), etc.
